# BIRYANI
## by Rounak Kumar on food
Okay, so if you don’t love biryani, then you’re doing it wrong. That is not normal at all. Who wouldn’t love a heavenly, succulent plate of biryani? Biryani is a dish, which bonds emotionally with a person who truly respects it’s existence. If you’re a hardcore biryani lover, then you sure know what I’m talking about.
1. The chicken leg indeed is the best piece.
2. Elaichi in biryani = Your darkest fear.
3. Every shaadi you go to, every dawat you go to; you’ll find biryani everywhere.
 Biryani is simply finger lickin’good!
